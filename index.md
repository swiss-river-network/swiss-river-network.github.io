# Overview

We collect water and meteo data in order to work on water temperature research.

## Graph Based Approach

In comparison to existing methods we put our focus on the connectivity of water and meteo stations.

## Goal

We want to explore the most recent methods on various water temperature related tasks like:

  * Water Temperature Prediction
  * Water Temperature Imputing
  * Water Temperature Pattern Recognition

## Progress

Check out our Publications.

## Contribute

We make our work available for Bachelor and Master theses.

Research institutions are welcome to contact us in order to access the latest code and data.
