### IN REVIEW

Downloads: comming soon

Recurrent Neural Networks do show their performance in time series modeling. So do Graph Neural Networks in modeling irregular neighboring structures. We propose a novel spatio-temporal architecture suited for water temperature modeling as well as other node-with-id networks.

### IN REVIEW

Downloads: comming soon

We propose a new LSTM tailored for water temperature modeling. Not only do we improve state-of-the-art performance by five percent, we also reduce the amount of learnable parameters by two orders of magnitude.

We use the connectivity of water stations to improve data imputing. We have a lot of missing data in our dataset and using the available measurements of neighboring stations improves the quality of data imputing by a lot.

### GBR: Graph Based Deep Learning on the Swiss River Network
Downloads: [PDF](./pdfs/Fankhauser-23_Graph_Based_Deep_Learning_on_the_Swiss_River_Network.pdf)

In this work we use the connectivity of water stations (namely the rivers). In a first step we predict the water temperature at each water station using an LSTM. Then we use the connectivity to refine these first predictions. Using the connectivity improves the state of the art at around 5%.

Jan Zurbr√ºgg, Downloads: [PDF](http://prg.inf.unibe.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bachelor_Thesis_Jan_Zurbrugg_Clustering_of_Hydrological_Stations.pdf)

The aim of this thesis is to divide hydrological stations into groups of similar dis-
charge and temperature behaviour. [..]
