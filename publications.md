We use the connectivity of water stations to improve data imputing. We have a lot of missing data in our dataset and using the available measurements of neighboring stations improves the quality of data imputing by a lot.

### GBR: Graph Based Deep Learning on the Swiss River Network
Downloads: [PDF](./pdfs/Fankhauser-23_Graph_Based_Deep_Learning_on_the_Swiss_River_Network.pdf)

In this work we use the connectivity of water stations (namely the rivers). In a first step we predict the water temperature at each water station using an LSTM. Then we use the connectivity to refine these first predictions. Using the connectivity improves the state of the art at around 5%.
